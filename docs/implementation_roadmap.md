## Phase 4: User Interface (Weeks 7-9)

### Week 7: API Layer

- Design RESTful API for task management
- Implement API Gateway configuration
- Create API handlers for task CRUD operations
- Add authentication and authorization using Amazon Cognito
- Implement API testing

### Week 8: Web Application Development

- Set up Elastic Container Service (ECS) for hosting
- Configure Amazon RDS for application data storage
- Design and implement task creation form
- Add task management dashboard
- Create schedule configuration interface
- Implement credential management UI (with Secrets Manager)
- Add prompt file editor/uploader

### Week 9: CLI Development

- Design CLI command structure
- Implement core CLI commands
- Add configuration management
- Create documentation
- Test CLI functionality

## Phase 5: Integration and Optimization (Weeks 10-12)

### Week 10: Integration Testing

- End-to-end testing of complete workflow
- Performance testing and optimization
- Security testing and vulnerability assessment
- Cross-browser and cross-device testing for UI

### Week 11: Documentation and Training

- Create user documentation
- Develop administrator guide
- Record training videos
- Prepare deployment guide

### Week 12: Final Review and Deployment

- Conduct final security review of all components
- Perform load testing on ECS, RDS, and AgentCore services
- Finalize CI/CD pipeline for all application components
- Prepare for production deployment with blue-green strategy
- Create comprehensive CloudWatch monitoring and alerting setup
- Verify all AgentCore components (Runtime, Gateway, Browser Tool, Identity, Observability)

## Ongoing Maintenance and Enhancement

### Post-Deployment Tasks

- Monitor system performance with CloudWatch dashboards
- Track AgentCore performance metrics via Observability
- Collect user feedback on web application and automation results
- Address bugs and issues in both infrastructure and application code
- Implement additional features based on feedback
- Keep dependencies and AWS services up to date
- Regularly review IAM permissions and security configurations
- Optimize costs for all AWS services (ECS, RDS, Lambda, AgentCore)

## Key Milestones

   - Document storage in S3
   - Secure credential management with Secrets Manager

2. **Alpha Release** - End of Phase 3

   - EventBridge scheduling capability
   - SES email notifications
   - Observability with CloudWatch
   - Basic error handling

3. **Beta Release** - End of Phase 4

   - Web application (ECS + RDS)
   - CLI interface
   - Full task management
   - Enhanced error handling and monitoring
   - Integration of all AgentCore components

4. **Production Release** - End of Phase 5
   - Complete end-to-end testing
   - Performance optimization
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Production-ready deployment with CI/CD

## Risk Mitigation

- **Browser Automation Complexity**: Regularly test with various website structures; leverage AgentCore Browser Tool capabilities; implement robust error handling
- **Security Concerns**: Regular security reviews; implement least-privilege IAM policies; use AWS Secrets Manager for credential protection
- **AgentCore Integration**: Create fallback mechanisms for AgentCore service disruptions; implement proper error handling for Gateway tool connections
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement throttling and queuing mechanisms; monitor usage with CloudWatch
- **Website Changes**: Design the system to be resilient to UI changes; implement alerts for automation failures
- **Data Security**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit; implement proper access controls for S3 and RDS
