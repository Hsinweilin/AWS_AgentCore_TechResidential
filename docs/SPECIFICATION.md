# AWS Bedrock Agent Web Automation System Specification

## 1. System Overview

The AWS Bedrock Agent Web Automation System is a cloud-based solution that automates browser interactions using AWS Bedrock's AgentCore capabilities. The system allows users to schedule automated tasks such as website logins and document downloads with secure credential management, customizable browser actions, and notification features.

## 2. Business Requirements

### 2.1 Core Functionality

- Automate browser interactions (login, navigation, document download)
- Schedule automated tasks to run at user-specified times
- Securely manage user credentials
- Support customizable browser instructions via prompt files
- Store retrieved documents in S3
- Notify users via email with document copies

### 2.2 User Experience

- Simple interface to submit website URLs
- Secure credential submission mechanism
- Flexible scheduling options
- Custom instructions support
- Email notifications for completed tasks

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 AWS Services Required

- **AWS Bedrock**: AI foundation model and AgentCore for browser automation
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for agent execution
- **Amazon S3**: Storage for prompt files and downloaded documents
- **AWS Secrets Manager**: Secure credential storage
- **Amazon EventBridge**: Task scheduling
- **Amazon SES**: Email notifications
- **IAM**: Security and permission management
- **CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging

### 3.2 System Components

#### 3.2.1 User Input Collection

- Web UI or CLI for submitting URLs, credentials, schedules, and prompt files
- API Gateway for RESTful interfaces

#### 3.2.2 Credential Management

- Secure storage in AWS Secrets Manager
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Access control via IAM policies

#### 3.2.3 Prompt File Management

- S3 storage for instruction files
- Version control support
- Template support for common operations

#### 3.2.4 Scheduling System

- EventBridge scheduler configuration
- Schedule modification capabilities
- One-time and recurring schedule support

#### 3.2.5 AI Agent Execution

- Lambda function to invoke Bedrock agent
- Tool connections for browser automation
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

#### 3.2.6 Document Storage

- S3 bucket for retrieved documents
- Organization by user/date/source
- Retention policy support

#### 3.2.7 Notification System

- SES email composition and delivery
- Document attachment or secure link
- Customizable notification templates

## 4. Data Flow

1. User submits website URL, credentials, schedule, and browser instructions
2. System securely stores credentials in AWS Secrets Manager
3. System stores browser instruction prompt file in S3
4. EventBridge scheduler is configured based on user schedule
5. At scheduled time, EventBridge triggers Lambda function
6. Lambda invokes Bedrock agent with necessary parameters
7. Agent retrieves credentials from Secrets Manager and prompt file from S3
8. Agent performs browser automation using Bedrock browser tool
9. Downloaded document is stored in S3
10. System sends email notification with document copy to user

## 5. Security Considerations

### 5.1 Credential Security

- No plaintext credentials in logs or storage
- Encrypted secrets in Secrets Manager
- Least privilege access principles

### 5.2 Data Protection

- Encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Secure access to downloaded documents
- Temporary credential usage

### 5.3 Access Control

- Fine-grained IAM permissions
- Authentication for all API operations
- Resource-based policies for S3 buckets

## 6. Scalability and Performance

- Serverless architecture for automatic scaling
- Optimization of Lambda execution time
- Parallel processing for multiple scheduled tasks
- Resource limits and throttling considerations

## 7. Monitoring and Logging

- CloudWatch logs for all components
- Error tracking and alerting
- Execution metrics and performance monitoring
- Audit logging for security events

## 8. User Interfaces

### 8.1 Management Console

- Task configuration interface
- Schedule management
- Credential management (without displaying actual values)
- Prompt file editor/uploader

### 8.2 API Endpoints

- RESTful API for programmatic access
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Documentation and SDK support

## 9. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

- Set up S3 buckets, SSM Parameter Store, IAM roles
- Implement basic Lambda function for agent invocation
- Create Bedrock agent with browser tool capability

### Phase 2: Automation Logic

- Implement credential retrieval
- Configure browser automation with prompt files
- Implement document saving to S3

### Phase 3: Scheduling and Notifications

- Implement EventBridge scheduler integration
- Add SES email notification system
- Set up document attachment or secure link generation

### Phase 4: User Interface

- Develop web interface or CLI for task submission
- Implement user management and authentication
- Add schedule management capabilities

### Phase 5: Testing and Optimization

- Security testing and hardening
- Performance optimization
- User acceptance testing

## 10. Limitations and Considerations

- Browser automation complexity and potential failures
- Website structure changes affecting automation
- Rate limiting and bot detection by target websites
- Cost considerations for AWS Bedrock usage
