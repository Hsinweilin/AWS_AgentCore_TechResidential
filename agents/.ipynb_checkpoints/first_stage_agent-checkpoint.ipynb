    "\n",
    "2. SECOND STAGE - Web Automation:\n",
    "   - Use the browse_web2 with FOUR arguments:\n",
    "     a. instruction: Include BOTH login details AND the task instructions\n",
    "     b. starting_url: The URL extracted from credentials\n",
    "     c. system_prompt: Use this: \"You are a helpful Web UI automation assistant. Follow the user prompt exactly. However, if the user promp want you to download a file, stop when you found the file and the download button, there will be next invoke that will download the file. \n",
    "        Very important: When you find the target file and it's download button or link, DO NOT click any download buttons. Making sure you found the file and it's download button and STOP automation.\n",
    "        Very important: If you find yourself repeating the same action (such as clicking a button, typing into a field, or submitting a form) more than 3 times without success, stop the automation immediately and return an error message describing the repeated failure. \"\n",
